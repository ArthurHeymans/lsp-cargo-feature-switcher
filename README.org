* lsp-cargo-feature-switcher

An Emacs package for interactively toggling Cargo features in Rust projects via LSP configuration.

** Features

- Find and parse ~Cargo.toml~ files
- Interactive menu to toggle Cargo features
- Automatically updates ~.dir-locals.el~ with LSP configuration
- Shows enabled features and their dependencies
- Supports toggling ~no-default-features~

** Dependencies

Requires my fork [[https://github.com/ArthurHeymans/emacs-toml][emacs-toml]], which supports TOML features that [[https://github.com/gongo/emacs-toml][gongo/emacs-toml]] does not.

** Usage

Run ~M-x cargo-features-toggle-menu~ to open the interactive feature selection menu.
